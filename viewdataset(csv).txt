Step 1: creating csv file (dataset .csv)
Step 2: Importing the dataset.
dataset <- read_csv("dataset.csv")
View(dataset)

Naïve Bayes :
Naive Bayes is a Supervised Non-linear classification algorithm in R 
Programming. Naive Bayes classifiers are a family of simple probabilistic 
classifiers based on applying Baye’s
theorem with strong(Naive) independence assumptions between the features 
or variables. The Naive Bayes algorithm is called “Naive” because it makes the 
assumption that the occurrence of a certain feature is independent of the 
occurrence of other features.

Dataset: Iris dataset consists of 50 samples from each of 3 species of Iris(Iris 
setosa, Iris virginica, Iris versicolor) and a multivariate dataset introduced by 
British statistician and biologist Ronald Fisher in his 1936 paper The use of 
multiple measurements in taxonomic problems. Four features were measured 
from each sample i.e length and width of the sepals and petals and based on the 
combination of these four features, Fisher developed a linear discriminant model 
to distinguish the species from each other.
